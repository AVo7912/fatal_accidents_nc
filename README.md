Our data is vast. After cleaning the file our team focusinmg on the year 2021 just after covid. For this we selected follwing  3 different tools 
1. Folium  - for interactive map -->Aline
2. Slemma - for browser based data visualization --> Bryan
3. Plotly.express - for Data visualization -->Annie

 Since our Team each member used different tools for reasearch we all sharing our own files not collabrated in a single file.
 
      
Major Findings:

1.	Heat Map, Choropleth map

2.	SQL Server, Slemma

3. Top 10 counties among 100 conties have most fatals using plotly.express bar graph.Which month of the year have more fatals using a histogram,
   bubble graph showing each couties have most fatals versus pedestrian involved, multiple bar chart with same data for all the counties.

4. April and October have more accidents. NOT in winter months.
